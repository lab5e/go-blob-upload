# Blob upload example

This is an example of blob uploads to Span (https://span.lab5e.com/). You'll need a client certificate with
intermediates and roots for a device to run this example.

Build with `go build`.

Go isn't the *obvious* embedded example but the code should be fairly easy read and to understand.
